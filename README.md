<!-- ![demo](assets/outcome.png) -->

Paste a video URL or upload a video/audio file. Violin transcribes the speech, translates it, synthesizes a target-language voice-over, aligns the dubbed audio to the source timestamps, and remuxes it into an MP4 with SRT/VTT/TXT subtitles plus a plain transcript.

Available as a **CLI**, a **FastAPI web app**, and a **Claude Code skill**.

---

## ✨ Features

- **33 target languages** with handpicked native-speaker voices for the 16 most-used ones (Cartesia Sonic 3 + ElevenLabs)
- **YouTube/URL or file input** — use the web app with a pasted URL, or upload MP4/MOV/MKV/WebM plus MP3/WAV/M4A/FLAC audio files
- **Timestamp-aligned TTS** — source gaps stay as gaps; each translated segment is placed on the original timeline
- **Subtitle and transcript outputs** — SRT, VTT, timestamped TXT, plain transcript TXT, and optional burned-subtitle MP4
- **Local Vietnamese preset** — `config/local_mac.yaml` / `config/local_gpu.yaml` run fully local: faster-whisper transcription, Gemma 4 (Ollama) translation, VieNeu-TTS v3 Turbo voices, no API keys
- **SQLite job history** — processed jobs are mirrored into `jobs/jobs.sqlite` for local history/resume
- **In-video Q&A** — ask questions about any moment in the dubbed video; answers use nearby subtitles plus sampled frames
- **Natural-language voice picker** — describe the voice you want, an LLM picks from the catalog
- **6 style profiles** *(experimental)* — standard / kids / academic / casual / storyteller / news
- **Pluggable stack** — Together / OpenAI / ElevenLabs interchangeable for every stage, one YAML

## 🚀 Quick start

### Try it without installing anything

The live demo runs at **<https://www.violin-ai.com>** — drop a short clip in, get a dubbed video out in a few minutes.

### Run locally

Requires **Python 3.10+** and **ffmpeg** on PATH.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh   # install uv if you don't have it
uv tool install violin                            # recommended — faster, isolated
# or: pip install violin                          # if you'd rather install into your current Python env

export TOGETHER_API_KEY=...                       # get one at https://api.together.ai (add to ~/.zshrc to persist)
```

Three ways to use it:

**1. CLI** — translate one file:

```bash
violin lecture.mp4 lecture_zh.mp4 --language Chinese
```

**2. Web app** — full REST API + browser UI:

```bash
violin-api
# → http://127.0.0.1:8000           (browser UI)
# → http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs      (interactive API docs)
```

**3. Claude Code skill** — invoke from any Claude Code session:

```bash
violin --install-skill          # one-time: copies the skill into ~/.claude/skills/
claude
> please use the violin skill to translate path/to/video.mp4 into Chinese
```

<details><summary>Run from source (for hacking on the pipeline)</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shang-zhu/violin.git
cd violin
uv sync
cp .env.example .env             # then fill in TOGETHER_API_KEY
uv run main.py lecture.mp4 lecture_zh.mp4 --language Chinese

# Fully-local Vietnamese dubbing (Mac M-series / NVIDIA) — no API keys
uv sync --extra local-mac            # or --extra local-gpu (see GPU torch note below)
# one-time: `ollama pull gemma4:12b-mlx` (Mac) / `gemma4:31b` (GPU); VieNeu downloads its weights on first run
uv run main.py lecture.mp4 lecture_vi.mp4 --language Vietnamese --config config/local_mac.yaml
```

To use the `violin` / `violin-api` commands globally while edits to your local source reflect immediately, install editable:

```bash
uv tool uninstall violin     # if you've installed the PyPI version
uv tool install --editable .
```

After this, `violin` / `violin-api` run from your local checkout — edit any file and the next invocation picks it up; no rebuild needed. To switch back to PyPI: `uv tool uninstall violin && uv tool install violin`.

## 🎬 How Violin works

```
Video / Audio / URL
  │
  ├─ yt-dlp / ffmpeg ─────────────► Download URL if needed, extract audio (16 kHz WAV)
  │
  ├─ Whisper Large v3 ────────────► Word-level timestamps → sentence segments
  │
  ├─ LLM (DeepSeek V4 Pro by default) ──► Translate each segment, respecting style profile
  │
  ├─ TTS (Cartesia / Edge-TTS / etc.) ───► Synthesize dubbed audio per segment
  │
  └─ ffmpeg ─────────────────────► Speed-align video to dubbed audio,
                                    concat with freeze-frame fallback,
                                    single-pass AAC encode the audio track,
                                    write output MP4 + subtitles + transcript
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Override any default by writing your own YAML and passing it with `--config my.yaml` — only the keys you want to change need to appear; values deep-merge with the [built-in defaults](https://github.com/shang-zhu/violin/blob/main/config/default.yaml).

### Switch providers

```yaml
# config/default.yaml — pick the stack you want
models:
  transcription:
    provider: together                  # together | openai
    model: openai/whisper-large-v3      # together → openai/whisper-large-v3 | openai → whisper-1
  translation:
    provider: together                  # together | openai
    model: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro  # together → deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro | openai → gpt-5.5
  tts:
    provider: together                  # together | elevenlabs | openai | edge | supertonic
    model: cartesia/sonic-3             # edge → edge-tts
```

### Production overrides

A starter `config/prod.yaml` is included for public deployments. It adds upload limits, serializes jobs, and caps ffmpeg concurrency. The included `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` + `Caddyfile` are how the live demo is hosted — `docker compose up -d --build` after filling `.env` is enough to put a copy of Violin behind auto-HTTPS on any Docker host.

### Environment variables

| Variable | When required | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `TOGETHER_API_KEY` | **Recommended** — covers every stage with the default config | Together AI API key |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Any stage uses `provider: openai` | Covers `whisper-1`, GPT models, and `tts-1` |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | TTS uses `provider: elevenlabs` | ElevenLabs API key |
| `OLLAMA_API_KEY` | Translation/chat uses `provider: ollama` | Ollama Cloud API key |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Optional | Comma-separated allowed origins (default: `*`) |

> You only need keys for the providers you actually pick. Pure-OpenAI deployments (all stages on `openai`) work too — `OPENAI_API_KEY` alone is enough. Same idea for ElevenLabs.

### Fully-local Vietnamese dubbing

`config/local_mac.yaml` (Apple Silicon) and `config/local_gpu.yaml` (NVIDIA) run every stage on-device — faster-whisper for transcription, Gemma 4 via Ollama for translation, VieNeu-TTS v3 Turbo for voice synthesis — with no API keys and no network access after the models are downloaded.

- **Fit stage** — after TTS, a syllable-budget fitter shortens translations that overrun their time slot and re-speeds/pause-borrows the audio to line up with the source timing. Per-unit details (budget, shortened text, measured overrun) are written to `<output>.fit.units.json`; pass `--no-fit` to disable the stage and keep the raw TTS timing.
- **Subtitle language** — both local presets default `subtitles.language: source`, so the SRT/VTT/TXT files (and burned-in subtitles) show the original English sentences re-timed to the dubbed video instead of the Vietnamese translation; pass `--subtitle-lang target` to get translated subtitles instead.
- **Ollama context length** — on a 24 GB GPU, set `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=8192` when serving `gemma4:31b`; otherwise Ollama defaults to a much larger context and spills part of the model to CPU.
- **Selecting a GPU by UUID** — with two or more identical cards, pick devices by UUID rather than index: run `nvidia-smi -L` to list each card's `GPU-<uuid>`, then set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=GPU-<uuid>` for `ollama serve` and for `uv run main.py` separately — index order (`0`/`1`) can be assigned differently to each process on identical cards, silently putting both on the same GPU and causing an OOM.
- **Keep Ollama warm** — set `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=30m` when running `ollama serve`; otherwise Ollama unloads the model after 5 minutes idle and the next stage pays a cold reload (tens of seconds for a 19 GB model).
- **Disable hidden thinking** — `translation.reasoning_effort: none` in the config stops Gemma 4's hidden reasoning pass, which is roughly 10× faster for translation.
- **GPU torch build** — the VieNeu GPU engine needs a CUDA build of torch, installed separately after `uv sync --extra local-gpu`:

  ```bash
  uv pip install "torch==2.8.0" "torchaudio==2.8.0" --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
  ```

## 🎭 Style profiles

Six built-in profiles tune both the translation LLM prompt and the TTS delivery. Use `--style <name>` on the CLI or pass `style` in API requests.

| Style | Tone | TTS speed | Emotion |
|-------|------|-----------|---------|
| `standard` | Faithful translation, natural voice | 1.0× | — |
| `kids` | Rewritten for a 7-year-old, plain language | 1.0× | excited |
| `academic` | Formal register, preserves jargon and honorifics | 0.95× | calm |
| `casual` | Spoken slang, contractions, friendly | 1.1× | content |
| `storyteller` | Vivid, dramatic narration | 0.9× | enthusiastic |
| `news` | Concise, declarative, broadcast-style | 1.0× | neutral |

Add your own by editing `prompts/styles.yaml`.

See all available styles: `violin --style list`.

## 💻 CLI usage

> Examples use the PyPI-installed `violin` command. If you're running from a git checkout, substitute `uv run main.py` for `violin` (and `uv run run_api.py` for `violin-api`).

```bash
# Basic
violin lecture.mp4 lecture_es.mp4 --language Spanish

# YouTube / URL input
violin "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=..." lecture_vi.mp4 --language Vietnamese --config config/local_mac.yaml

# Audio input also works; output is an MP4 suitable for subtitles/burn-in
violin podcast.mp3 podcast_vi.mp4 --language Vietnamese --config config/local_mac.yaml

# Pick a style
violin talk.mp4 talk_zh.mp4 --language Chinese --style kids

# Pick a specific voice
violin lecture.mp4 lecture_fr.mp4 --language French --voice "french narrator man"

# Skip SRT
violin lecture.mp4 lecture_ja.mp4 --language Japanese --no-subtitles

# Write SRT/VTT/TXT and a burned-subtitle copy
violin lecture.mp4 lecture_vi.mp4 --language Vietnamese --subtitle-formats srt,vtt,txt --burn-subtitles

# Full replacement (no original audio underneath)
violin lecture.mp4 lecture_ko.mp4 --language Korean --no-voiceover

# Custom config (e.g. switch to OpenAI/ElevenLabs)
violin lecture.mp4 lecture_it.mp4 --language Italian --config config/other_api.yaml
```

### CLI flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--language` / `-l` | *(required)* | Target language name (e.g. `Spanish`, `Japanese`) |
| `--voice` / `-v` | auto | TTS voice. Defaults to the primary native voice for the target language |
| `--source-language` | `auto-detect` | Source language hint for translation |
| `--no-subtitles` | off | Skip SRT generation |
| `--subtitle-formats` | `srt` | Comma-separated subtitle sidecars: `srt,vtt,txt` |
| `--subtitle-lang` | config `subtitles.language` | `source` = original sentences re-timed to the output video, `target` = translated text |
| `--burn-subtitles` | off | Also write `<output>_subtitled.mp4` with subtitles burned in |
| `--voiceover` / `--no-voiceover` | voiceover on | Keep original audio underneath the dub, or full replacement |
| `--style` / `-s` | `standard` | Style profile name. Use `--style list` to see all |
| `--config` / `-c` | `config/default.yaml` | Path to a YAML override file |
| `--timings-out` | off | Write per-step wall-clock timings + cost as JSON |

## 🛰️ Web app & REST API

```bash
violin-api                              # default dev mode
violin-api --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080   # bind everywhere
violin-api --config config/prod.yaml    # production overrides (requires a git checkout for config/prod.yaml)
```

Core flow: `POST /jobs` or `POST /jobs/from-url` to start, `GET /jobs/{id}` to poll, then download `/video`, `/srt`, `/vtt`, `/txt`, `/transcript`, or `/video-burned`. `GET /jobs/history` reads local SQLite job history. Full list with request/response schemas at **`/docs`**.

### Example

```bash
# Submit
JOB=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/jobs \
  -F "file=@lecture.mp4" \
  -F "language=Spanish" \
  -F "style=academic" \
  -F "subtitle_formats=srt,vtt,txt" \
  -F "burn_subtitles=true" | jq -r .id)

# Poll
curl -s http://localhost:8000/jobs/$JOB | jq '{status, progress}'

# Download
curl -OJ http://localhost:8000/jobs/$JOB/video
curl -OJ http://localhost:8000/jobs/$JOB/srt
curl -OJ http://localhost:8000/jobs/$JOB/transcript
```

Job data lives under `jobs/{id}/`. Set `api.job_ttl_hours` to auto-delete jobs older than N hours (default `0` = disabled; `config/prod.yaml` uses 24h for the public demo).
